ProtoObject subclass: #Object	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: 'DependentsFields'	poolDictionaries: ''	category: '10Pines-C17-2-Model'!!Object commentStamp: '<historical>' prior: 0!Object is the root class for almost all of the other classes in the class hierarchy. The exceptions are ProtoObject (the superclass of Object) and its subclasses.Class Object provides default behavior common to all normal objects, such as access, copying, comparison, error handling, message sending, and reflection. Also utility messages that all objects should respond to are defined here.Object has no instance variables, nor should any be added. This is due to several classes of objects that inherit from Object that have special implementations (SmallInteger and UndefinedObject for example) or the VM knows about and depends on the structure and layout of certain standard classes.Class Variables:	DependentsFields		an IdentityDictionary		Provides a virtual 'dependents' field so that any object may have one		or more dependent views, synchronized by the changed:/update: protocol.		Note that class Model has a real slot for its dependents, and overrides		the associated protocol with more efficient implementations.Because Object is the root of the inheritance tree, methods are often defined in Object to give all objects special behaviors needed by certain subsystems or applications, or to respond to certain general test messages such as isMorph.Miscellanous Discussions.About at: index accepting float and not only integers This behavior is also free in the sense that the failure code is only invoked when theprimitive fails and so adds nothing to the cost of successful accesses,which are the high dynamic frequency operation.  It will also show up underprofiling if one is concerned about efficiency, and so isn't a hidden cost.It is also in keeping with Smalltalk's mixed mode/arbitrary precisionimplicit coercion number system that one *can* use fractions or floats asindices.  Stripping out coercions like this will make the system more brittle.  So please do *not* remove this "hack".  I think it's a feature and a useful  one.Can you give me an example that demonstrates the usefulness of thisfeature?| a r |a := Array new: 10 withAll: 0.r := Random new.100 timesRepeat: [| v | v := r next * 10 + 1. a at: v put: (a at: v) + 1].ai.e. I didn't have to provide an explicit rounding step.  That's useful.  But in general anywhere where an index is derived by some calculation not having to provide the rounding step could be useful/helpful/more concise.  e.g. (n roundTo: 0.1) * 10 vs ((n roundTo: 0.1) * 10) asInteger.Some thought went into the original choice.  It is not a hack but there by intent.  The integers are simply a subset of the reals and forcing the programmer to use them is favouring the machine above the programmer.But I think you should justify getting rid of it rather than my having to justify keeping it.  Getting rid of it risks breaking code.  If it is there but does not harm then why get rid of it?best Eliot Miranda !!Object methodsFor: '*Morphic-Core' stamp: 'JuanVuletich 11/1/2010 15:18'!currentWorld	"Answer a morphic world that is the current UI focus."	^UIManager default currentWorld! !!Object methodsFor: 'block support' stamp: 'ClementBera 6/28/2013 10:20'!mustBeBooleanIn: context	"context is the where the non-boolean error occurred.

If you make a subclass of a class which contains a primitive method, 	the subclass inherits the primitive.  The message which is implemented 	primitively may be overridden in the subclass (E.g., see at:put: in String's 	subclass Symbol).  The primitive behavior can be invoked using super (see 	Symbol string:). 	 	A class which attempts to mimic the behavior of another class without being 	its subclass may or may not be able to use the primitives of the original class.  	In general, if the instance variables read or written by a primitive have the 	same meanings and are in the same fields in both classes, the primitive will 	work.  	For certain frequently used 'special selectors', the compiler emits a 	send-special-selector bytecode instead of a send-message bytecode.  	Special selectors were created because they offer two advantages.  Code 	which sends special selectors compiles into fewer bytes than normal.  For 	some pairs of receiver classes and special selectors, the interpreter jumps 	directly to a primitive routine without looking up the method in the class.  	This is much faster than a normal message lookup. 	 	A selector which is a special selector solely in order to save space has a 	normal behavior.  Methods whose selectors are special in order to 	gain speed contain the comment, 'No Lookup'.  When the interpreter 	encounters a send-special-selector bytecode, it checks the class of the 	receiver and the selector.  If the class-selector pair is a no-lookup pair, 	then the interpreter swiftly jumps to the routine which implements the 	corresponding primitive.  (A special selector whose receiver is not of the 	right class to make a no-lookup pair, is looked up normally).  The pairs are 	listed below.  No-lookup methods contain a primitive number specification, 	<primitive: xx>, which is redundant.  Since the method is not normally looked 	up, deleting the primitive number specification cannot prevent this 	primitive from running.  If a no-lookup primitive fails, the method is looked 	up normally, and the expressions in it are executed. 	 	No Lookup pairs of (class, selector) 	 	SmallInteger with any of		+ - * /  \\  bitOr: bitShift: bitAnd:  // 	SmallInteger with any of		=  ~=  >  <  >=  <= 	Any class with					== 	Any class with 					@ 	Point with either of				x y 	Context with					blockCopy: 	BlockContext with either of 		value value:	"	self error: 'comment only'! !!Object class methodsFor: 'documentation' stamp: 'MarcusDenker 7/7/2016 15:42'!whatIsAPrimitive	"Some messages in the system are responded to primitively. A primitive   	response is performed directly by the interpreter rather than by evaluating   	expressions in a method. The methods for these messages indicate the   	presence of a primitive response by including <primitive: xx> or 	<primitive: 79 error: ec>before the first expression in the method.   		In the second case, ec is a special temporary variable that holds an error code. 	In the VM primitive, failure is indicated by a variable called primFailCode being 	non-zero. On activating a method with a failing primitive, if the index is in 	bounds of the 	primitiveFailCodes array in the VMspecialObjectsArray then the 	failure code substitutes the symbol in the 	primitiveFailCodes array, otherwise 	it supplies the integer value.	  	Primitives exist for several reasons. Certain basic or 'primitive' 	operations cannot be performed in any other way. Smalltalk without 	primitives can move values from one variable to another, but cannot add two 	SmallIntegers together. Many methods for arithmetic and comparison 	between numbers are primitives. Some primitives allow Smalltalk to 	communicate with I/O devices such as the disk, the display, and the keyboard. 	Some primitives exist only to make the system run faster; each does the same 	thing as a certain Smalltalk method, and its implementation as a primitive is 	optional.  	  	When the Smalltalk interpreter begins to execute a method which specifies a 	primitive response, it tries to perform the primitive action and to return a 	result. If the routine in the interpreter for this primitive is successful, 	it will return a value and the expressions in the method will not be evaluated. 	If the primitive routine is not successful, the primitive 'fails', and the 	Smalltalk expressions in the method are executed instead. These 	expressions are evaluated as though the primitive routine had not been 	called.  	  	The Smalltalk code that is evaluated when a primitive fails usually 	anticipates why that primitive might fail. If the primitive is optional, the 	expressions in the method do exactly what the primitive would have done (See 	Number @). If the primitive only works on certain classes of arguments, the 	Smalltalk code tries to coerce the argument or appeals to a superclass to find 	a more general way of doing the operation (see SmallInteger +). If the 	primitive is never supposed to fail, the expressions signal an error (see 	SmallInteger asFloat).  	  	Each method that specifies a primitive has a comment in it. If the primitive is 	optional, the comment will say 'Optional'. An optional primitive that is not 	implemented always fails, and the Smalltalk expressions do the work 	instead.  	 	If a primitive is not optional, the comment will say, 'Essential'. Some 	methods will have the comment, 'No Lookup'. See Object 	howToModifyPrimitives for an explanation of special selectors which are 	not looked up.  	  	For the primitives for +, -, *, and bitShift: in SmallInteger, and truncated 	in Float, the primitive constructs and returns a 16-bit 	LargePositiveInteger when the result warrants it. Returning 16-bit 	LargePositiveIntegers from these primitives instead of failing is 	optional in the same sense that the LargePositiveInteger arithmetic 	primitives are optional. The comments in the SmallInteger primitives say, 	'Fails if result is not a SmallInteger', even though the implementor has the 	option to construct a LargePositiveInteger. For further information on 	primitives, see the 'Primitive Methods' part of the chapter on the formal 	specification of the interpreter in the Smalltalk book."			self error: 'comment only'! !!Object class methodsFor: '*Polymorph-Widgets' stamp: 'gvc 1/31/2009 15:53'!taskbarLabel	"Answer the label string for the receiver in a task bar	or nil for the default."	^nil! !Object subclass: #Address	instanceVariableNames: 'id streetName streetNumber town zipCode province'	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: '10Pines-C17-2-Model'!!Address methodsFor: 'street' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 13:27'!streetNumber: aStreetNumber 	streetNumber := aStreetNumber ! !!Address methodsFor: 'street' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:12'!streetName	^streetName ! !!Address methodsFor: 'street' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 13:27'!streetName: aStreetName 	streetName := aStreetName ! !!Address methodsFor: 'street' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:12'!streetNumber	^streetNumber ! !!Address methodsFor: 'zip code' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:08'!zipCode: aZipCode 	zipCode := aZipCode! !!Address methodsFor: 'zip code' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:13'!zipCode	^zipCode! !!Address methodsFor: 'twon' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:12'!town	^town! !!Address methodsFor: 'twon' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:07'!town: aTown 	town := aTown! !!Address methodsFor: 'province' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:11'!province	^province! !!Address methodsFor: 'province' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/28/2016 16:08'!province: aProvince 	province := aProvince	! !Object subclass: #ClassMapping	instanceVariableNames: 'mappedClass mappings tableName'	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: '10Pines-C17-2-Model'!!ClassMapping methodsFor: 'table' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/31/2016 23:25'!tableName		^tableName ! !!ClassMapping methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/31/2016 23:02'!isFor: aClass	^mappedClass = aClass! !!ClassMapping methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 10/31/2016 23:25'!initializeFor: aClass into: aTableName mappingAll: aCollectionOfMappings	mappedClass := aClass.	tableName := aTableName.	mappings := aCollectionOfMappings ! !!ClassMapping methodsFor: 'mapping' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 11/1/2016 00:42'!unmap: aRecord using: aDataBaseSession	| unMappedObject |	unMappedObject := mappedClass basicNew.	self unmapIdOf: aRecord into: unMappedObject.	self unmap: aRecord into: unMappedObject using: aDataBaseSession.	^ unMappedObject! !!ClassMapping methodsFor: 'mapping' stamp: 'HernanWilkinson 11/1/2016 00:40'!map: anObject using: aDataBaseSession	| record |	self toDo: 'se puede optimizar usando array para registros y guardando definicion de tabla una vez'.	record := Dictionary new.		self mapIdOf: anObject into: record using: aDataBaseSession.	self mapEmbededOf: anObject into: record.	"agrego aca el registro y no luego de mapear el id para que lo agrege completo.

Class String provides the abstract super class for ByteString (that represents an array of 8-bit Characters) and WideString (that represents an array of  32-bit characters).  In the similar manner of LargeInteger and SmallInteger, those subclasses are chosen accordingly for a string; namely as long as the system can figure out so, the String is used to represent the given string.Strings support a vast array of useful methods, which can best be learned by browsing and trying out examples as you find them in the code.Here are a few useful methods to look at...	String match:	String contractTo:String also inherits many useful methods from its hierarchy, such as	SequenceableCollection ,	SequenceableCollection copyReplaceAll:with:!!String methodsFor: '*Multilingual-TextConversion' stamp: 'KR 1/30/2006 21:49'!convertToEncoding: encodingName	^self convertToWithConverter: (TextConverter newForEncoding: encodingName).!
